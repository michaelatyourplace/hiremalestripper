            <h2>Planning Your Charleston Entertainment Experience</h2>
            
            <h3>Best Times to Visit</h3>
            <p>While Charleston offers year-round entertainment, certain seasons provide unique advantages. Spring and fall offer perfect weather for combining outdoor and indoor activities. Summer brings beach party opportunities but also peak tourist season. Winter provides the best hotel deals and less crowded venues while maintaining mild temperatures perfect for celebration.</p>

            <h3>Group Size Considerations</h3>
            <p>Charleston accommodates groups of all sizes, but planning ahead becomes crucial for larger parties. Groups of 8-12 will find it easy to move between venues spontaneously. Larger groups of 15 or more benefit from advance reservations and possibly hiring transportation to keep everyone together throughout the evening.</p>

            <h3>Budget Planning</h3>
            <p>Charleston entertainment spans all budget levels. You can craft an affordable celebration by focusing on happy hour specials and local favorites, or go all-out with VIP bottle service, private venues, and premium entertainment. Most groups find that planning for a mid-range experience provides the best value while ensuring a memorable night.</p>
